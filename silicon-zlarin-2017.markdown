## 1st Statebox Summit 2017

<img style="width: 100%" src="/img/zlarin.jpg">

Statebox is hosting its first summit on the beautiful island of Zlarin
in Croatia.

## About

[Event agenda (detailed)](/zlarin-2017-info.html)

We are inviting a small group of experts with different backgrounds with
a focus on mathematics and computer science to collaborate on the early
prototype of the Statebox language and its core principles.

Research in mathematics and computer science should have a paramount
role in the design of software, in particular for the blockchain
environment. Thus, the aim of this gathering is to bring together
experts from different scientific fields and create a fertile ground for
discussion and collaboration. By the end of this seven-day summit, we
hope to have formed a strong community interested in what we do, willing
to help us lay out the best mathematical formalization for its
underlying core.

A preliminary outline of the topics covered in the gathering:

 - Petri Nets
 - String Diagrams
 - Open Games
 - Functional Programming
 - Information Gain Computing
 - Formal Verification
