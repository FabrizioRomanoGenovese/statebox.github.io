This is research I worked on for 15 years, spanning life, the universe and
<strong>everything</strong>: from computer programming, quantum physics, space-time and
consciousness.

<h4>General Idea</h4>

Statebox is build from various principles of linear logic, functional programming,
information theory, reversible computing, operad theory and diagrammatic languages.

It tries to separate 'distributed state' from 'localised state', or 'process'
from 'computation'. In a sense, <em>there is no time in statebox</em>.

A process itself is glued together from smaller consitituents:
- the empty process `{}`
- the one place process, partially  defining a term "term"
- "flat composition" the quotient of a set of processes
- "nested composition" the embedding of a process in a token

A process is defined as a petrinet with some extra structure. An instance
of a process is a path through it's state space. This path can be any monad,

State itself is considered to be build up out of content-adressed data,
linked in a blockchain fashion.

the basis is "s ---[t]---> s"
